    <h5>Vae Victis' ultimate 3D Printing Guide</h5>
    <p>At the start of the 2016 school year, George Mason High School was proud to annouce its new Makerspace. Team 1418 has access to several 3D printers in this space, which have been used to create specialized parts for the robot as well as team giveaways. Other clubs and classes at the school have access to this tool as well for creating all manner of three dimensional conceptual models. We do a lot of 3D Printing on our team, and we have organized a large body of knowledge in our <a href="files/3d-printing-guide.pdf">3D Printing Guide</a>.</p>
