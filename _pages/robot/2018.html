    <h1>2018 Robot</h1>
    <!--TODO: add images-->
    <p>The 2018 game's fusion of 20th century arcade gamming and 21st century robotics is possibly one of the most challenging scenario to date. For a more detailed description of the game, see the <a href="https://youtu.be/HZbdwYiCY74">the official video reveal</a>.</p>
    <h5>Robot Abilities</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arcade Drive:</strong> Fittingly, arcade drive will be our drive method of choice this year. This allows</li>

        <!--TODO: Add the length of the crane arm here-->
        <h6>Delivery Crane Mechanisms</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Power Cube Delivery Crane:</strong> From the begining, the focus of our robot was to deliver power cubes to the scale; however, this goal possed some very specific problems. The following mechanisms are our our solutions for these issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Hand and Wrist:</strong> At the end of the crane arm sits the robotic hand and wrist. Their purpose is to hold onto the power cubes. Currently, the hand consists of two "fingers" (short lengths of 80/20) that come togther via a pneumatic cyliander. This hand can be rotated in order to properly manuever the power cube.</li>
          <li><strong>Crane Arm:</strong> Situated two feet above the base of the chassis itself on two 80/20 supports, the power cube crane arm is powered by a banebots motor attached to a makeshift transmission giving a high tourqe output. This output helps to lift the large, telescoping arm and the wrist and hand.</li>
          <li><strong>Crane Transmission:</strong> Built onto the supporting structures of the crane arm, hand, and wrist, our makeshift gearbox takes the tourque from a banebots motor and amplifies it. This makes it possible to lift large amounts of mass.</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Climbing Mechanisms</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Winch:</strong> Utilizing a massive gear reduction gearbox and a large hook, our robot has the capabillity to climb the scale.</li>
          <!--TODO: Add more specific details about the hook and the tether.-->
          <li><strong>Crane Hook:</strong> To fulfill our secondary objective--to climb the scale--we attached a large hook to the end of the robot arm. This hook is attached to a strap of webbing, which, in turn, is attached to </li>
        </ul>
        <!--TODO: Add the specific weight of the robot later.-->
        <!--TODO: get images or videos of the intake in action.-->
        <li><strong>Power Cube Intake</strong> Our power cube intake is designed to have dual functionallity, both intaking and delivering power cubes to the portal. Currently, our intake is powered by two redline motors for the intake themselves, and two 72 rpm motors controlling the swinging movements of the intake arms themselves, with major changes expected in the near future.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Programming</h5>
    <p>As in years past, our robot's code will be written in Python, while our driverstation (a graphical user interface that communicates between the drivers and the robot) utilizes a combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The framework for the driverstation can be found <a href="https://github.com/FRCDashboard/FRCDashboard">FRCDashboard</a>here.</p>
    <!--TODO: Possibly add the veiwfine or an explaination of why we aren't using a viewfine-->
    <!--TODO: add clause about vision-->
    <p></p>
    <p>As usual, our code is open source, and can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/frc1418">our GitHub organization</a>. Here are some quick links:</p>
