    <h1>2018 Robot</h1>
    <!--TODO: add images-->
    <!--TODO: Add more to line 12-->
    <p>The 2018 game's fusion of 20th century arcade gamming and 21st century robotics is possibly one of the most challenging scenario to date. For a more detailed description of the game, see the <a href="https://youtu.be/HZbdwYiCY74">the official video reveal</a>.</p>
    <h5>Robot Abilities</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arcade Drive:</strong> Fittingly, arcade drive will be our drive method of choice this year. This allows</li>
        <!--TODO: Add more details about the crane-->
        <!--TODO: Add the length of the crane arm here-->
        <li><strong>Power Cube Delivery Crane:</strong> From the begining, the focus of our robot was to deliver power cubes to the scale; however, this goal possed some very specific problems. The following mechanisms are our our solutions for these issues.</li>
        <h6>Delivery Crane Mechanisms</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Crane Arm:</strong> Situated two feet above the rest of </li>
          <li><strong>Crane Hook:</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Hand and Wrist:</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <!--TODO: Add the specific weight of the robot later.-->
        <!--TODO: Add more specific details about the hook.-->
        <li><strong>Climber:</strong> Utilizing a massive gear reduction gearbox and a large hook, our robot has the capabillity to climb the scale.</li>
        <!--TODO: get images or videos of the intake in action.-->
        <li><strong>Power Cube Intake</strong> Our power cube intake is designed to have dual functionallity, both intaking and delivering power cubes to the portal. Currently, our intake is powered by two redline motors for the intake themselves, and two 72 rpm motors controlling the swinging movements of the intake arms themselves, with major changes expected in the near future.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Programming</h5>
    <p>As in years past, our robot's code will be written in Python, while our driverstation (a graphical user interface that communicates between the drivers and the robot) utilizes a combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The framework for the driverstation can be found <a href="https://github.com/FRCDashboard/FRCDashboard">FRCDashboard</a>here.</p>
    <!--TODO: Possibly add the veiwfine or an explaination of why we aren't using a viewfine-->
    <!--TODO: add clause about vision-->
    <p></p>
    <p>As usual, our code is open source, and can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/frc1418">our GitHub organization</a>. Here are some quick links:</p>
