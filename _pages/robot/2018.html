    <h1>2018 Robot</h1>
    <!--TODO: add images-->
    <!--TODO: Add more to line 12-->
    <p>The 2018 game's fusion of 20th century arcade gamming and 21st century robotics is possibly one of the most challenging scenario to date. For a more detailed description of the game, see the <a href="https://youtu.be/HZbdwYiCY74">the official video reveal</a>.</p>
    <h5>Robot Abilities</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arcade Drive:</strong> Fittingly, arcade drive will be our drive method of choice this year. This allows</li>
        <li><strong>Power Cube Delivery Crane:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Climber:</strong>Utilizing a massive gear reduction gearbox and milled slots into a rotating plate, we are able to latch onto a knot, pulling our 110 pound robot up into the scoring an onto the rising airship.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Programming</h5>
    <p>As in years past, our robot code will be written in Python, while our driverstation, a graphical user interface that communicates between the drivers and the robot, utilizes a combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The framework for this station can be found <a href="https://github.com/FRCDashboard/FRCDashboard">FRCDashboard</a>here.</p>
    <!--TODO: I don't think we use this HUD thing-->
    <p>As an addendum to our dashboard, we used a company-donated <a href="https://vufine.com">VUFINE</a> wearable display to build a heads-up robot monitor which assisted our driver. The display allowed easy viewing of our robot's camera feed and some vital statistics of the robot. To build the display, we used a modified version of FRC Dashboard, connected with our standard dashboard through NetworkTables for ease of control.</p>
    <p>We drive using a pilot-copilot operating system with one driver controlling robot motion and the other controlling all other robot functions. This allows each driver to control their own independent task, making operating the robot more efficient.</p>
    <!--TODO: add clause about vision-->

    <p>As usual, our code is open source, and can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/frc1418">our GitHub organization</a>. Here are some quick links:</p>
