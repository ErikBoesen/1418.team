    <h1>2018 Robot</h1>
    <!--TODO: add images-->
    <p>The 2018 game's fusion of 20th century arcade gamming and 21st century robotics is possibly one of the most challenging scenario to date. For a more detailed description of the game, see the <a href="https://youtu.be/HZbdwYiCY74">the official video reveal</a>.</p>
    <h5>Robot Abilities</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arcade Drive:</strong> Fittingly, arcade drive will be our drive method of choice this year. This allows</li>
        <li><strong>Power Cube Delivery Crane:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Climber:</strong>Utilizing a massive gear reduction and milled slots into a rotating plate, we are able to latch onto a knot, pulling our 110 pound robot up into the scoring an onto the rising airship.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Programming</h5>
    <p>Like in previous years, we used Python for our robot code. In addition to our robot code, we developed a dashboard for our touchscreen driver station. It is written in JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and communicates with the robot through a python-based tornado server. It is based on the <a href="https://github.com/FRCDashboard/FRCDashboard">FRCDashboard</a> framework we developed last year.</p>
    <p>As an addendum to our dashboard, we used a company-donated <a href="https://vufine.com">VUFINE</a> wearable display to build a heads-up robot monitor which assisted our driver. The display allowed easy viewing of our robot's camera feed and some vital statistics of the robot. To build the display, we used a modified version of FRC Dashboard, connected with our standard dashboard through NetworkTables for ease of control.</p>
    <p>We drive using a pilot-copilot operating system with one driver controlling robot motion and the other controlling all other robot functions. This allows each driver to control their own independent task, making operating the robot more efficient.</p>
    <p>Our vision system uses newly introduced WPILib cscore to operate three cameras and preform image processing on gear vision target to deliver gears to the airship.</p>
    <p>As usual, our code is open source, and can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/frc1418">our GitHub organization</a>. Here are some quick links:</p>

    <h5>Competition Performance</h5>
    <p>During the 2017 season, we were part of the first-seeded alliance at the Northern Virginia District Event, then made it to the finals at the Northern Maryland District Event. At the Chesapeake District Championship sponsored by Booz Allen Hamilton, we qualified for the FIRST World Championship for the second year in a row. In St. Louis, we made it further than ever before; narrowly losing in a quarterfinal tiebreaker. We are very proud of our performance and are constantly working to do even better next season.</p>
    <p>This robot is no longer in use, and has been put on display in the George Mason High School Library.</p>
