    <h5>Alumni Quotes About Team 1418</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><blockquote>"My experiences on team 1418 were the most formative of my adolescence. They convinced me that I'd enjoy writing software for a living."</blockquote><p> — Bjorn Westergard (2006 graduate)</p></li>
        <li><blockquote>"My experience with Team 1418 was hugely influential...I'm now in my third year working for a technology startup (we make power electronics for solar and battery systems). I can't think of better preparation for this kind of work than being on a FIRST team." </blockquote><p> — Rachel Taylor (2007 graduate)</p></li>
        <li><blockquote>"Team 1418 taught me that teamwork, communication, and a common vision are just as key to success as the design and engineering of the robot." </blockquote><p> — Alex Nette (2005 graduate)</p></li>
        <li><blockquote>"1418 was how I originally gained numerous skills that I use every day today. This includes both technical skills -- machining, soldering, electronics, designing, building...technical drawing, computer programming, vector math, etc. etc. etc. -- and also soft skills -- teamwork, problem solving, project planning, work ethic, leadership, working under pressure, staying focused, learning new skills fast, prioritizing work when you have limited resources, [and] bouncing back from failure." </blockquote><p> — Rachel Taylor (2007 graduate)</p></li>
