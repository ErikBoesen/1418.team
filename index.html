        <p>We are team 1418 Vae Victis, a <a href="http://firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)</a> team from George Mason High School in Falls Church, VA. Since our founding in 2004, our team has grown in every way, and has maintained a high place in competition and in the community. To do this, we maintain an active and engaged student body of about 25 students who work with the team on and off season. We attend competitions, volunteer, take part in community events, build robots, and have lots of fun.</p>
        <p>In the 2016 season, we were part of the winning and first-seeded alliance in the FIRST Chesapeake Northern Virginia Event at Battlefield High School in Haymarket, VA. Then, we led the first-seeded alliance to victory at the FIRST Chesapeake Greater DC Event at Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Maryland. We then led the first-seeded alliance to another stunning victory at the FIRST Chesapeake District Championship sponsored by Booz Allen Hamilton in the University of Marylandâ€™s Xfinity Center in College Park, Maryland. This qualified us for the FIRST World Championship. After a challenging but thrilling fight at worlds, we made it to the division quarterfinals in the 2016 Newton Division, one of the strongest divisions in FIRST history.</p>
        <p>During the 2017 season, we were part of the first-seeded alliance at the Northern Virginia District Event, then made it to the finals at the Northern Maryland District Event. At the Chesapeake District Championship sponsored by Booz Allen Hamilton, we qualified for the FIRST World Championship for the second year in a row, and can't wait to attend it from April 26-29th.</p>
