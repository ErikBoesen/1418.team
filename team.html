  <h1><a name=history></a>History</h1>
  <h3> Vae Victis </h3>
  <p>In 390 BC, a Gallic tribe led by Brennus overran and conquered the still-young city of Rome. As ransom, he demanded a thousand pounds of gold and (in an extraordinarily rare submission) this was acquiesced to by the Romans.

During the weighing process, it was discovered that Brennus was using false weights on the scales; they were heavier than stated, designed to cheat the Romans out of more gold than had been stipulated. When confronted about this, he threw his own sword onto the scales, adding even <i>more</i> weight to the payment required, and declared "VAE VICTIS"! </p>
